# What is DB Browser
DB Browser is a visual tool used to organize commands sent to SQLite. With databases, it’s easy to lose track of commands that have been run. DB Browser lets you see exactly the sequence of commands you are executing before you run them. DB Browser will also allow you to see the column structure for the tables within the database you’re working with, so inserting data or other manipulation of data is more manageable and doesn’t require performing queries every time you need to remember the structure of your data.

#
DB Browser has packages available for each operating system on the right panel of the DB Browser website. (http://sqlitebrowser.org/)
Unless you created a shortcut during installation, the DB Browser for SQLite.exe file will be in the C:\Program Files\DB Browser for SQLite path.
